# Building a Maze

Follow the instructions on my.kenzie.academy

possibly make an array
or nested for loops

Jamal Smilez and Shamesha helped me with this project.




need to make the "start" box move when arrow keys are depressed.
need to create a way for the boxPlayer to stay on "space" tiles and cannot cross "wall tiles
need to get boxPlayer tile onto coordinates (9,0)
and get boxKid tile onto coordinates (8,20)


need to embed home made video onto videoBox
want to make a hover for tile (8,20)
want to find url video of screaming banshi to place as the hover activation.
have to figure out how to prevent the keylog from showing on html page when using the arrow keys **  I BELIEVE I HAVE THIS ONE FIGURED OUT

nextUp.className !== "wall"
follow for the other arrow directionals.  use the proper - signs for each
